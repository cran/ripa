R Dependencies
--------------

The ripa package is built on top of some other R packages,
all available from CRAN.

Instead of each of these other packages being a dependency (Depend:)
they are listed as suggested packages (Suggests:). This way, they will
not all be loaded when ripa is started.

Many of the packages are only required for specific
functionality. Ripa will check the availability of a package and
notify the user of its absence.

Alternatively, when installing the ripa package, include the
Suggests dependencies:

> install.packages("ripa", dependencies=c("Depends", "Suggests"))

Running the package
-------------------

To run the package just run RIPAgui() after the command library(ripa)
